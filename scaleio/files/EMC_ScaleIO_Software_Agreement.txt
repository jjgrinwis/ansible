character arising as a result of this Agreement or out of the use (or Use) or inability to use (or

computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if 
such Customer has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
B. No Indemnification for Intellectual Property. EMC shall have no liability to Customer for any 
action (and all prior related claims) brought by or against Customer alleging that Customer's use 
(or Use) or other disposition of any Software infringes any patent, copyright, trade secret or

CASE, EMC'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING WITH RESPECT TO THIS 
AGREEMENT WILL NOT EXCEED FIFTY UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($50).  SOME
